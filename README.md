# Flight_Data

A Python / PostgreSQL project in which the dataframe was created using PostgreSQL 

After data types was implictly stated for each column, the data was uploaded to my PostGres server 

I then pulled this data into a python file and turned it into a python data frame and performed anaylsis on it
